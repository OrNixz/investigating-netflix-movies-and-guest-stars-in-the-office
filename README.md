# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

This project is the first given by the DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python track. On the inside, we have to implement what we have learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to complete this project task. Such tools as Pandas (including DataFrame Creation, DataFrame Subsetting, DataFrame Column Selection, and DataFrame Iteration), Matplotlib (including line plots and scatter plots), file reading (CSV), dictionaries, and lists are utilized in this project.

## Project Tasks
