# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

This project is the first given by the DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python track. On the inside, we have to implement what we have learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to complete this project task. Such tools as Pandas (including DataFrame Creation, DataFrame Subsetting, DataFrame Column Selection, and DataFrame Iteration), Matplotlib (including line plots and scatter plots), file reading (CSV), dictionaries, and lists are utilized in this project.

## Project Description
You will use the skills you gained in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to address a real-world data science challenge in this project. You'll use everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib to figure out if Netflix movies are growing shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office."

You'll also receive hands-on experience with an important data science skill: exploratory data analysis. This will enable you to accomplish crucial activities such as modifying raw data and extracting inferences from data visualizations. To begin, press the play button!
